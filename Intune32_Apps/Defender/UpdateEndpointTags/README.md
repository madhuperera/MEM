## Device Tag Detection Script

This PowerShell script checks if the specified key in the registry exists, and if it exists, whether the value of that key matches a specified value. If the key and value exist and match, the script exits with a success message and a code of 0. If the key and value do not exist or do not match, the script exits with a failure message and a code of 1.

## Device Tag Installation Script

This PowerShell script creates a new key in the registry if it does not already exist and sets the value of that key to a specified value. This script can be used to update the Device Tags for Defender for Endpoint in order to manage and monitor them more effectively.

Please make sure you understand what you are doing before you use the script. Make sure you test it in a non-production environment before you use it in production. And also make sure you have the right permissions to make these changes.

## Note
This script is intended to be used with Microsoft Intune Win32 App.
